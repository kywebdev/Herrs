                <p>Ed Herr grew up in the snack food business and aspired early on to dedicate his professional career to advancing Herr Foods Inc. As President, Ed’s responsibilities range from general administration of the $250 million family business, including sales, marketing and manufacturing, to management of fleet, farms and properties. He also oversees the company’s activities in the areas of charitable giving and community and corporate relations.</p>
                <p>In late 1998, Ed Herr was introduced to customers and consumers as the new Herr Foods spokesman, assuming a role long held by his father, Jim Herr, who started the business in 1946. Ed has fully enjoyed the opportunity to represent Herr’s in television commercials and in other public appearances. He admits that filling his father’s shoes will be an ongoing process, one he looks forward to pursuing.</p>
                <p>Ed has a life-long devotion to his community, which he has demonstrated through active service. He serves on the boards of a number of organizations. Locally these include: Oxford Mainstreet Inc., the Oxford Senior Center, and the Lighthouse Youth Center. In 2009, Ed helped to found a local faith community, SILO – Serving, Inspiring, Loving Others, and currently serves on the Leadership Team. Ed also serves on the board of the Navigators Church Discipleship Ministry headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado and the board of New York City Relief. Fundamental to all of Ed’s business and civic pursuits is a deep religious commitment, which influences all of his relationships and activities.</p>
                <p>A life-long resident and booster of Nottingham Pennsylvania, Ed has raised seven children and is the proud grandfather of 13 grandchildren. In his spare time, Ed enjoys exercise, golf, travel and yard work.</p>

So don't sacrifice the pleasure of foods you enjoy, just read the "Nutrition Facts" label on packages and keep the following facts top of mind:</p><ul><li>Calories and fat need to be monitored, but not at the expense of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, sugars, protein, dietary fiber and taste.</li><li>High fat foods can be mixed with low fat foods as long as your total diet does not exceed recommended averages. The USDA Dietary Guidelines recommend that no more than 30% of total daily calories come from fat. For a 2000 calorie diet, that means 65 grams and for a 2500 calorie diet, 80 grams.</li><li>To keep calories, fat and essential nutrients within a 2000 or 2500 calorie diet, vary the plan.</li></ul>

            <p class="important">The good news is, smart snacking is easy. Potato chips, pretzels, tortilla chips and popcorn fit comfortably within the bread group because of their levels of dietary fiber and complex carbohydrates. Each has a manageable amount of calories and fat per serving, not to mention some significant surprises, such as vitamin C, calcium and potassium. Herr's Snacks are available in a variety of forms to meet many preferences and needs, from lightly salted to low-fat and fat-free.</p>

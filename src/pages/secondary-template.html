            <ul>
                <li>Your tour will take up to 1 hour depending on the manufacturing schedule. Since our tour is based on live manufacturing, live tours are usually more likely Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and video-only tours are a higher probability Thursday and Friday. Schedules can change without notice.</li>
                <li>Please wear flat rubber soled shoes. This is a walking tour. There are no seating areas along the tour route. During your tour you will walk outdoors between 3 different buildings. Please feel free to bring rain gear along. In the event of a thunderstorm, tours may be interrupted.</li>
                <li>Arrive 10 minutes prior to your scheduled tour time and check in at the front desk using your group name or last name. (While we try our best to accommodate late arrivals, we are not always able to do so.)</li>
                <li>The use of cameras and cell phones are not permitted on the tour.</li>
                <li>We are a tobacco free campus.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Our tour is Handicap Accessible:</strong></h3>
            <p>Please let us know in advance of the special needs of your group so that we can best accommodate you. If we know your needs in advance it allows us to schedule staff accordingly to provide you with the best experience possible.</p>
